# Download
For standalone lua with version 5.3 or higher: use modules that end in "S" ("BigintLibrary-X-XS" or "BigintLibrary-NEWEST-S").

For Roblox luau, or standalone lua with version 5.2 or below: use modules that end in "R" ("BigintLibrary-X-XR" or "BigintLibrary-NEWEST-R").

Modules ending with "R" require the Bit32 library, which is pre-installed into Roblox Studio.

Standalone ports will be less common, since the library is intended for Roblox.
